VPN Implementation and Analysis


📘 Overview


This project demonstrates the working of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using a mobile device. The experiment verifies IP address masking, location change, browsing speed comparison, and VPN functionality.


🎯 Objective

To understand how a VPN protects user privacy by:
Changing the IP address
Masking the real location
Encrypting internet traffic
Comparing browsing speed before and after VPN usage

🛠 Tools Used

Android Mobile Phone
Turbo VPN (Free Version)
Google Chrome Browser
https://whatismyipaddress.com
https://speedtest.net

🧪 Experiment Procedure

1️⃣ Checking Original IP Address
Ensured VPN was turned OFF.
Opened browser and visited whatismyipaddress.com.
Noted the original IP address and location.

2️⃣ Connecting to VPN
Opened Turbo VPN application.
Selected available server location.
Connected successfully.

3️⃣ Verifying IP Address Change
Revisited whatismyipaddress.com.
Observed that the IP address and location were changed.
Confirmed that the IP displayed matched the VPN server IP.

4️⃣ Testing Browsing Speed
Accessed websites like Google and YouTube.
Observed page loading time.
Compared speed using speedtest.net.

5️⃣ Disconnecting VPN
Turned OFF the VPN.
Checked IP address again.
Observed IP returned to original.
Compared browsing performance.

Result

The VPN successfully masked the real IP address and routed traffic through a remote server. The IP shown in the VPN application matched the IP displayed on whatismyipaddress.com.

📌 Conclusion

VPN enhances online privacy and security by encrypting internet traffic and hiding the real IP address. However, it may slightly reduce browsing speed due to encryption and rerouting through a remote server.
